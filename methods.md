#Data Sources

The datasets used for extracting building-level attributes and local climate variables include open access datasets available in the Google Earth Engine archive. The datasets used and the features extracted from them are listed below.
1. Building footprints/outlines
	+ [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
3. Building Age
	+ [World Settlement Footprint & Evolution](https://samapriya.github.io/awesome-gee-community-datasets/projects/wsf/)
	+ [DynamicWorldV1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_DYNAMICWORLD_V1)
4. Building Height
	+ [Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus 30m DEM](https://samapriya.github.io/awesome-gee-community-datasets/projects/fabdem/)
	+ [Copernicus Digital  Elevation Model (GLO-30 DEM)](https://samapriya.github.io/awesome-gee-community-datasets/projects/glo30/)
5. Degree days 
	+ [ERA5-Land Hourly](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_LAND_HOURLY)

What did you do to prepare the data?

#Machine Learning / Modeling

#Data Challenges


**Tools (aka “component specification”)**

What software packages, modules, etc. did you use? 
What are the dependencies between these and how did you render them interoperable?

**Processes**

What does your workflow or pipeline look like? 
What steps did you follow? 

**Analyses**

What approaches did you try that didn’t work?
What analyses did you end up sticking with?

**Limitations**

What are the shortcomings of your approach?
How can your work be improved?
