***Background***

What question(s) are you answering?
What need are you filling?

***Goal***

We aim to develop a model that predicts heating loads for residential and commercial buildings in Alaska. Our work is in contrast to current scholarship & research for the Alaska region. 

Current work only focuses on time-intensive, micro-level approaches. Researchers take measurements, install meters, and wait for month for results from individual building since this approach has been the only one yielding results.
In contrast, our top-down, large-scale approach allows us to estimate the heating needs for large parts of Alaska at once. 

***Experts***

An in-depth understanding of the current state of Alaska heating needs is required and helpful to put this project into context. Therefore, the team conducted various meetings and interviews with subject-matter experts. The meetings included individual interviews with researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), scientists, and Alaska-based heating experts. Additionally, the team met with a group of experts whose research focuses on heating needs in Alaska.

These meetings allowed the team to gain a better understanding of the technical aspects associated with heating needs in Alaska as well as potential social, interpersonal, and ethical implications of this work. 

This work has immediate application oppurtunities, since it will enable researchers to do large-scale calculations for Alaska, which was previously not possible. Additionally, these results can be used for sustainability and decarbonization policy implementations. Lastly, this approach can be expanded to the greater arctic region, which share similar challenges to Alaska.
