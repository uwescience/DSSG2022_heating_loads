We are motivated :)

**Background**

What question(s) are you answering?
What need are you filling?

**Goal**

We aim to develop a model that predicts heating loads for residential and commercial buildings in Alaska. Our work is in contrast to current scholarship & research for the Alaska region. 

Current work only focuses on time-intensive, micro-level approaches. Researchers take measurements, install meters, and wait for month for results from individual building since this approach has been the only one yielding results.
In contrast, our top-down, large-scale approach allows us to estimate the heating needs for large parts of Alaska at once. 

**Experts**

Who are the important stakeholders and what has your team done to take them into consideration?
What are the use cases youâ€™re building for?

**Ethical Implications**

What are the ethical questions you considered as a team?
How are you addressing them in your work?
