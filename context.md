### Background

Global warming presents the most pressing challenge of our generation. Compared to the global average, temperatures are rising at four times the rate in Alaska. Carbon emissions to meet energy needs contribute to Alaska’s increasing temperatures. Therefore, there is a huge and increasing urgency to decarbonize energy sources, particularly in Alaska. In order to reduce the accelerating impacts of climate change reductions in emissions are vital and national and local decarbonization is critical.

Our research initially focuses on Alaska’s electrical Railbelt region which is comprised of the service areas of six regulated public utilities that extend from Fairbanks to Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula. Since residential and commercial heating makes up a large part of global warming contributions, understanding the current state of energy needs is vital in reducing heating demands.

This project aims to drastically improve the ways heating loads are estimated in Alaska. The state of Alaska has unique needs and challenges compared to the rest of the U.S. such as less centralized energy, a culture of independence, and overall colder temperatures. The lack of centralized energy information is a key reason for this project in the first place, and filling this data gap, to better understand the current state of energy and heating needs in Alaska, is a key goal of this project.

We do so by taking a geospatially informed approach. This means we use large-scale satellite data to get information with high granularity. Heating load calculations for buildings are estimated in British thermal units (BTUs) per year and BTU per year per square foot. In order to calculate heating loads using a geospatial approach, local climate conditions and building features such as heights, base areas, and age are used. 


### Goal

We aim to develop a model that predicts heating loads for residential and commercial buildings in Alaska. Our work is in contrast to current scholarship & research for the Alaska region. 

Current work only focuses on time-intensive, micro-level approaches. Researchers take measurements, install meters, and wait for month for results from individual building since this approach has been the only one yielding results.
In contrast, our top-down, large-scale approach allows us to estimate the heating needs for large parts of Alaska at once. 

### Experts

An in-depth understanding of the current state of Alaska heating needs is required and helpful to put this project into context. Therefore, the team conducted various meetings and interviews with subject-matter experts. The meetings included individual interviews with researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), scientists, and Alaska-based heating experts. Additionally, the team met with a group of experts whose research focuses on heating needs in Alaska.

These meetings allowed the team to gain a better understanding of the technical aspects associated with heating needs in Alaska as well as potential social, interpersonal, and ethical implications of this work. 

This work has immediate application oppurtunities, since it will enable researchers to do large-scale calculations for Alaska, which was previously not possible. Additionally, these results can be used for sustainability and decarbonization policy implementations. Lastly, this approach can be expanded to the greater arctic region, which share similar challenges to Alaska.
