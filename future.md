## Where can you find more?
This project continues! In 2022, look out for our fellow abstracts and presentations at UW's [Learning and Doing Data for Good](https://escience.washington.edu/data-for-good-conference-2022) conference, [AGU's Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting), and [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc). In addition, several fellows will work ongoingly with the project as part of their theses. Finally, you can check out our team's code on GitHub, linked in the sidebar.

## Next Directions
<align="right" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/future.png" width="200">
+ Incorporating public energy retrofit database (Alaska Retrofit Information System) into models
+ Adding climate simulation models at different resolutions
+ Sensitivity exploration, e.g. effects of heating by building story
+ Hourly heating load estimates
+ Widening scope beyond Railbelt to Alaska and beyond
